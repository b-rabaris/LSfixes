### SCENARIO ONE: THE ASSASSINS

#### INTRODUCTION
The Marsec corporation manufactures the best weapons in the galaxy, but its boss, Sterner Regnix, uses unsavoury methods to extract the best from his top scientists. The use of mind control drugs and cybernetic implants is widely used, but officially denied by Marsec. The Inter-stellar Trading Standards Authority is powerless to intervene. A small band of ex-employees have decided to assassinate Sterner Regnix. They have located his private home on the planet CX-1 and will stop at nothing until Sterner is dead.

#### DEPLOYMENT

_ASSASSIN SQUAD_: Deploy on the red and yellow deployment squares around the house. Entrance to the house can be gained through opening the east or west doors.

_DROID SQUAD_: Sterner Regnix and his body guard of combat droids deploy on the blue squares inside the house.

#### VICTORY CONDITIONS

_ASSASSIN SQUAD_: If the Assassins manage to eliminate Sterner Regnix they win the game.

_DROID SQUAD_: The droid squad wins if they eliminate all the assassins and Sterner Regnix remains alive.

### SCENARIO TWO: MOONBASE ASSAULT

#### INTRODUCTION
The Omni Corporation's moonbase on Arid-6 holds security information on the 30 billion population of galaxy sector nine. Somewhere in sector nine is the rebel star system, the infamous 'Rebelstar', which still remains a secret from all its enemies. However the Arid-6 moonbase represents the biggest threat to the rebels so far with an increasing amount of data on rebel movements. A small band of rebels have penetrated the moon's outer defences and are poised to launch an attack on the moonbase itself.

#### DEPLOYMENT

_LASER SQUAD_: Deploy on the red and yellow squares outside the moonbase. Entrance can only be gained by opening the airlocks.

_OMNI CORP._: Deploy on the magenta squares inside the moonbase.

#### VICTORY CONDITIONS

_LASER SQUAD_: A sufficient number of Databanks and Analysers must be destroyed to guarantee victory. A Databank is worth five victory points and an Analyser is worth two. The Laser Squad wins if 100 victory points are gained.

_OMNI CORP._: The Omni Corporation wins if all the Laser Squad is eliminated.

### SCENARIO THREE: RESCUE FROM THE MINES

#### INTRODUCTION
A routine rebel mission has gone badly wrong. A reconnaisance mission in one of the Metallix corporation's mine installations has resulted in death of most members of a rebel squad. However all is not lost. Three members of the squad have been imprisoned on one level of the mine and they have vital information on the mine complex. A small squad has hastily been assembled to free the prisoners.

#### DEPLOYMENT

_LASER SQUAD_: Deploy the red and yellow squares on the top left and top right of the map.

_METALLIX CORP._: Deploy on blue squares in the mine complex.

#### VICTORY CONDITIONS

_LASER SQUAD_: All three of the prisoners must escape to guarantee victory. Once a prisoner is released from his cell move him to an elevator door and move into the elevator to escape.

_METALLIX CORP._: The Metallix corporation wins if at least five of the rebels are killed.
